# Benchmark

## Dataset

The following benchmark requires the KITTI odometry evaluation dataset. You can download the full dataset (80GB) from [the official dataset page](https://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/eval_odometry.php) or a part of the dataset (500 frames in 00 sequence, 622MB) from [google drive (KITTI00.tar.gz)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h9tARKvX6BwLfc_vfMfdxuP3bSbmgjmd/view?usp=sharing).

Note that because the original KITTI dataset is distributed under the CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 license, the derived dataset (KITTI00.tar.gz) must not be used for commercial purposes.

## Results

All benchmarks were conducted on the KITTI 00 sequence.

### Downsampling

```bash
cd small_gicp/scripts
./run_downsampling_benchmark.sh /path/to/kitti/velodyne
python3 plot_downsampling.py
```

- Single-threaded `small_gicp::voxelgrid_sampling` is about **1.3x faster** than `pcl::VoxelGrid`.
- Multi-threaded `small_gicp::voxelgrid_sampling_tbb` (6 threads) is about **3.2x faster** than `pcl::VoxelGrid`.
- `small_gicp::voxelgrid_sampling` gives accurate downsampling results (almost identical to those of `pcl::VoxelGrid`) while `pcl::ApproximateVoxelGrid` yields spurious points (up to 2x points).
- `small_gicp::voxelgrid_sampling` can process a larger point cloud with a fine voxel resolution compared to `pcl::VoxelGrid` (for a point cloud of 1000m width, minimum voxel resolution can be 0.5 mm).

- While TBB shows slightly better scalability, both the parallelism backends do not obtain a speed gain for the cases with threads more than 16.

### KdTree construction

```bash
cd small_gicp/scripts
./run_kdtree_benchmark.sh /path/to/kitti/velodyne
python3 plot_kdtree.py
```

- Multi-threaded implementation (TBB and OMP) can be up to **4x faster** than the single-threaded one (All the implementations are based on nanoflann).
- ~~The processing speed gets faster as the number of threads increases, but the speed gain is not monotonic sometimes (because of the scheduling algorithm or some CPU(AMD 5995WX)-specific issues?)~~.
- The new KdTree implementation shows a good scalability thanks to its well balanced task assignment.
- This benchmark only compares the construction time (query time is not included).

### Odometry estimation

```bash
cd small_gicp/scripts
./run_odometry_benchmark.sh /path/to/kitti/velodyne
python3 plot_odometry.py
```

- Single-thread `small_gicp::GICP` is about **2.4x and 1.9x faster** than `pcl::GICP` and `fast_gicp::GICP`, respectively.
- `small_gicp::(GICP|VGICP)` shows a better multi-thread scalability compared to `fast_gicp::(GICP|VGICP)`.
- `small_gicp::GICP` parallelized with [TBB flow graph](src/odometry_benchmark_small_gicp_tbb_flow.cpp) shows an excellent scalability to many-threads situations (**~128 threads**) but with latency degradation.

**SIMD intrinsics (-march=native)** (We recommend keeping this feature disabled unless you are 100% sure what it is)

- `BUILD_WITH_MARCH_NATIVE=ON` enables platform-specific intrinsics and squeezing the performance (**1.1x speedup for free**).
- However, you must ensure that all involved libraries are built with `-march=native`, otherwise the program will crash.
- Generally, it is difficult to properly set `-march=native` for all libraries, and we recommend keeping `BUILD_WITH_MARCH_NATIVE=OFF`.

Results:
- `BUILD_WITH_MARCH_NATIVE=OFF` : `Eigen::SimdInstructionSetsInUse()=SSE, SSE2`
- `BUILD_WITH_MARCH_NATIVE=ON` : `Eigen::SimdInstructionSetsInUse()=AVX, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, SSE4.1, SSE4.2`

**Accuracy**

- `small_gicp::GICP` outputs mostly identical results to those of `fast_gicp::GICP`.
- The results of `small_gicp::VGICP` slightly differ from `fast_gicp::VGICP`. Although the difference is marginal, it needs to be investigated.
